<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>  An Undergrad student, pursuing fourth semester of B.Tech. CSE, I aspire to build a strong set of skills which would empower me to explore the infinite possibilities technology offers for a better tomorrow. Independent yet a friendly team worker, intuitive and inquisitive, I am diligent and determined to accomplish my goals with sincerity and discipline. I endeavour to learn and master the intricacies of coding and the latest technologies, and wish to embark on a journey filled with challenges and setting standards.
